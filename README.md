## Problem Statement

## Idea
In today's world, people are often reluctant to buy goods from small scale sellers to avoid frauds. This effects the users as well as the sellers in many different ways. Here, our idea comes into picture.
Our application empowers small scale businesses by using the blockchain as well as the machine learning and connects them on social media platforms like instagram. 
We have used smart contracts to ensure the integrity of the transactions on out platform.

## Our Approach
The sellers can login to our portal through their metamask wallet and fill the necessary details. The sellers can also list their product on our portal and all the details of the product are stored on the polygon blockchain and the product images are stored using filecoin.
Similarly, the buyer can also login through their metamask wallet and see all the listed products. They have an option to search the required product. To buy the product the buyer has to send the required amount through his metamask wallet.
The customers will also be recommended products based on their ratings. Our model uses a dataset of various users and finds out the most suitable recommendations for the user.
Our model is deployed as a flask API using app services on Azure.

## Future Scope
We will partner up with delivery services. We will also include a medium through which customers could interact with sellers. We will also introduce features for influencers and allow people to follow their favourite sellers.
We will also add AR/VR technologies to allow people to try out various products at their home. People having similar interests could join to form communities or groups.
